This folder contains useful code that is not used in this project. This is a re-write in C of the FORTRAN code of the Steiner convective classification that was used 10 years ago in PyART (before it switched to a native Python version). The C version was the basis to write the cython version used in this project. We decided to keep the C version of the steiner algorithm as it might be usefull.
